# BlueCollar

> A Comprehensive Coworking and Workspace Management System — powered by [Stellar](https://stellar.org)

BlueCollar is a full-stack monorepo platform designed to streamline **coworking and workspace management** for hubs, shared offices, and enterprise workspaces. It combines a modern web frontend, a robust REST API backend, and on-chain smart contracts deployed on the **Stellar** blockchain via **Soroban** — enabling trustless payments, membership tokens, and access control.

## About

BlueCollar handles the everyday operational needs of tech hubs and coworking spaces — from managing members and tracking workspace usage to biometric attendance and on-chain payment escrow. The platform is modular, scalable, and built with real-world enterprise requirements in mind.

This project is built on top of the **Stellar network**, leveraging **Soroban smart contracts** (written in Rust) for:
- Membership token issuance
- Workspace booking with payment escrow
- Role-based access control on-chain

---

## Key Features

- **Biometric Authentication** — Clock-in/clock-out for users and staff via biometric verification.
- **User & Role Management** — Granular account roles and permissions (admin, member, staff).
- **Workspace Tracking** — Real-time monitoring of seat usage, room bookings, and resource allocation.
- **On-Chain Payments** — Stellar-powered payment escrow for workspace bookings.
- **Membership Tokens** — Soroban-based membership NFT/token contracts.
- **Analytics & Logs** — Attendance history, activity logs, and usage reports.
- **Team Collaboration** — Multi-user teams with delegated admin roles.
- **Modular Architecture** — Each package (frontend, backend, contracts) is independently deployable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 14
- **Rust** toolchain (`rustup`)
- **Stellar CLI** ≥ 23.x

Install Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
```

Install Stellar CLI:
```bash
# macOS/Linux via Homebrew
brew install stellar-cli

# or via cargo
cargo install --locked stellar-cli@23.1.3
```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bluecollar.git
cd bluecollar

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# 3. Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend && npm install
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Key variables to configure in `backend/.env`:

| Variable         | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|

---

## Running the Project

**Backend (NestJS):**
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
# API available at http://localhost:3001
```

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# App available at http://localhost:3000

## Stellar / Soroban Contracts

All smart contracts live in the `contracts/` directory and are written in **Rust** targeting the **Soroban** runtime on Stellar.

### Build a contract
```bash
cd contracts/workspace_booking
stellar contract build
# Output: target/wasm32v1-none/release/workspace_booking.wasm
```

### Run tests
```bash
cd contracts/workspace_booking
cargo test
```

### Deploy to testnet
```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/workspace_booking.wasm \
  --source-account <your-account> \
  --network testnet \
  --alias workspace_booking
```
